Analogy Between Client and Server

The client side of a client-server relationship is like a customer while the Server side is the waiter. The client will be the one
requesting some sort of service and the server side will perform the service. The role of the server side is to perform actions asked for
by the client. Just like a waiter in a restaurant, the server will be servicing multiple clients .
